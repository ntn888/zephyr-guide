I have just discovered the alternate RTOS, [RT-Thread](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread) and decided to move on to it.

It has good support for the RISC-V chips, and mainly for the cheap chips/boards that can be purchased through outlets such as Aliexpress. I'm a big fan of these cheap low cost dev boards.

RT-Thread is now estimated to be the 3rd most contributed rtos!

This book will stale as in it's current state, and I have no plans to progress. But fortunately it cover's the most basic chapters, good for a beginner.
