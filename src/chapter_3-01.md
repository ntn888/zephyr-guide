# Device Tree 101

Zephyr uses the device tree, a concept borrowed from Linux. It is a prerequisite to understand this before making any additions to the target board (Zephyr has a predefined set of popular boards, see [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html)). However we will cover it now before our discussion on peripheral APIs since they build on this and understanding the device tree could ease the process.

But there is already a good video preliminary on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9CZ1Uk3OYQ&t=6105s) that'll help you get started. It's quite long (~ 2 hours) and informative. This will help you navigate the device tree specification viewable on [devicetree.org](https://www.devicetree.org/) to fill in the gaps.
