# The Zephyr Guide

Hello.

This book will cover all basic aspects of the Zephyr RTOS, to help you get started quickly. Primarily though it will be concerned with the peripheral API, since this is the most I struggled with starting, and is the least well documented in the official docs. A rough overview is as follows:

- Environment Setup

- Kernel API - Primitives

- Basic Peripherals API

- Kernel API - Advanced

- Device Drivers

So buckle up and enjoy the ride...
