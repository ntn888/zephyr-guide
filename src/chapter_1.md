# Installation

The official docs have a great section on getting the environment setup. (That's about all that's good of the offical docs IMO)
See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

A follow up to this, the [Application Development](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/application/index.html) page explaining about how to go about creating a new application folder structure from scratch, is also good.

Once you get this under the belt, you're ready to start building Zephyr applications. This book provides easy hand-holding in the initial phases. So flip over, and let's get started.
